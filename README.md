These advancements have transformed the software engineering landscape, enabling the development of complex, high-quality software systems that meet evolving user needs and expectations.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) consists of the following phases:

1. Planning: Define project scope, goals, timelines, budget, and resources.

2. Requirements Gathering: Collect and document user requirements and expectations.

3. Analysis: Examine and validate requirements to ensure clarity and feasibility.

4. Design: Create detailed design specifications, including architecture and user interfaces.

5. Implementation(Coding): Develop the software, writing code in chosen programming languages.

6. Testing: Verify software meets requirements through various testing techniques (unit, integration, system, acceptance).

7. Deployment: Release software to production, making it available to end-users.

8. Maintenance: Provide ongoing support, fix issues, and update software as needed.

These phases may vary depending on the development methodology (e.g., Waterfall, Agile, Iterative). The SDLC provides a framework for managing software development projects, ensuring quality, and meeting user needs.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology involves;
- Linear, sequential approach
- Phases completed one after another
- Emphasis on predictability and control
- Little flexibility for change

Agile Methodology involves;
- Iterative, incremental approach
- Phases overlap, with continuous improvement
- Emphasis on flexibility, collaboration, and rapid response to change

Comparison;
- Waterfall: Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, fixed timelines, and limited changes expected.
- Agile: Suitable for projects with uncertain or changing requirements, need for rapid adaptation, and collaborative environment.

Scenarios;
- Waterfall:
    - Developing a simple website with fixed content and design.
    - Creating a small mobile app with well-defined features.
- Agile:
    - Developing a complex software system with evolving requirements.
    - Building a scalable e-commerce platform with frequent feature updates.

Key differences
- Waterfall: Focuses on predictability, control, and phase-by-phase completion.
- Agile: Emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering refers to the process of designing and optimizing text prompts or inputs to effectively interact with AI models, such as language models, chatbots, or other machine learning systems. It involves crafting clear, concise, and well-defined prompts that elicit specific, accurate, and relevant responses from the AI model.

Importance of Prompt Engineering:
1. Improved Accuracy: Well-designed prompts help AI models understand the context and intent, leading to more accurate responses.
2. Enhanced User Experience: Effective prompts facilitate seamless interactions, making it easier for users to achieve their goals.
3. Increased Efficiency: Optimized prompts reduce the need for follow-up questions or clarifications, saving time and resources.
4. Better Data Quality: High-quality prompts lead to better training data, which improves AI model performance and reliability.
5. Reduced Bias: Carefully crafted prompts can help mitigate bias in AI responses by providing balanced and inclusive context.
6. Increased Flexibility: Prompt engineering enables users to adapt AI models to specific tasks, domains, or applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
Write something about dogs.

Improved Prompt:
Write a 2-paragraph informative article about the benefits of adopting senior dogs from shelters, including their typical temperament and potential health advantages.

Improved Prompt is More Effective because it provides:
1. Specific Topic: The improved prompt clearly defines the topic, focusing on senior dogs and their adoption benefits.
2. Clear Structure: The prompt requests a specific format (2-paragraph article), making it easier for the AI model to understand the expected output.
3. Defined Tone and Style: The prompt implies an informative tone, helping the AI model to adopt the appropriate language and style.
4. Concise Language: The improved prompt is direct and to the point, avoiding ambiguity and ensuring the AI model understands the task.
5. Well-Defined Requirements: The prompt specifies the content (benefits, temperament, health advantages), ensuring the AI model provides relevant information.

The improved prompt guides the AI model to produce a targeted, informative, and structured response, increasing the likelihood of a high-quality output.
